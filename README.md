A program to find the shortest path between two points.\n
Implements pathfinding algorithms including depth-first search, breadth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm, and the A* algorithm.\n
Interacts with the user through the command line, allowing them to select board size and starting/ending points.\n
Shows a visualization of the path made by the algorithm of choice.\n
